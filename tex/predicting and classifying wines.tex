\title{Predicting and classifying wines based on physical and chemical properties}
\maketitle
\begin{flushleft}
Wine is a \href{https://www.zionmarketresearch.com/report/wine-market}{circa \$300b industry}, and somewhat unique in the modern age; whilst most consumer goods are 
specified and produced in a controlled manner with \href{https://www.isixsigma.com/new-to-six-sigma/what-six-sigma/}{six sigma type methods}, 
wine varies significantly not just between brands, 
but between batches. 
\end{flushleft}
The question set is:
\\~\\
"Chemically speaking, what types of wine are there? What predicts wine quality?"
\\~\\
This question comes in two parts: the latter is more traditionally suited to regression techniques, 
the former appears little more towards neural net approaches, although testing for collinearity and bimodals
can still be of use.
\\~\\
The \href{http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/}{dataset} consists of 6497 wines (1599 red, 4898 white) which have been assigned a quality rating (the dependent variable) from 0-10.  
10 (independent) variables have been measured: fixed and volatile acidity, citric acid levels, residual sugar, chlorides, free and total sulfur dioxide,
density, pH, sulphates and alcohol content (the dataset is complete, though units are not provided). 
\\~\\
On a superficial level, there are clearly two types of wine: red and white, although that may be considered anthropomorphic.  T-test of the two datasets
confirms they are significantly ($\alpha < 0.01$) different in every measured variable, although alcohol content is marginal. Red wines have greater (fixed and volatile) acidity, chlorides and sulphates, and white wines have greater citric acid (132 red wines had no detectable citric acid at all), 
residual sugar, and (free and total) sulfur dioxide.

\section*{Types of wine}
llustrates correlation between different measured properties (darker colours indicate a greater association).  Some correlations are intuitive; 
e.g. citric acid, fixed acidity and low pH are all correlated.
Density is correlated with many factors in both red and white wines: this may also be intuitive as density is an aggregate property of the 
constituent chemicals.
alcohol is correlated with a lower density (alcohol has a lower density than water), 
fixed acidity and residual sugars are correlated with higher density.  
For red wines only, chlorides are correlated with sulphates.

\section*{Finding predictors}
It would be reasonable to assume that that winemakers have roughly optimised each chemical present, so that the optimum lies somewhere within the space 
tested: in this case a quadratic fit is appropriate.  It is equally possible that some quantities should simply be maximised.
\\~\\
Properties matching the stricter quadratic criteria are: for red wines, sulphates and citric acid; 
for white wines, free and total sulfur dioxide.  For red wine only, increasing alcohol content increased perceived quality ($\alpha < 0.01$).  
For both types, volatile acidity, chloride and density should be minimised.
\\~\\
Quality red wines (scoring 6 or higher) have on average significantly ($\alpha < 0.01$) lower volatile acidity, higher citric acid (and therefore lower pH),
higher sulphates, and higher alcohol, than poor reds (scoring 4 or lower).\linebreak
Quality white wines (scoring 6 or higher) have on average significantly ($\alpha < 0.01$) lower fixed and volatile acidity, higher residual sugar, lower chlorides, higher free sulfur dioxide but not total sulfur dioxide, lower density, than poor whites (scoring 4 or lower).\linebreak
Both scored higher for higher alcohol content.  Combining this with quadratic regressions, predictors of wine quality are
summarised in figure \ref{fig:recipe}.
